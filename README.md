Task Board
This is a KanBan board for task managment.
WHen the page is opened the user is present with an add task button.
When the add task button is clicked, the user is prompted to enter three fields: a title, a due date and a description.
At the bottom of the add task window is a submit button that reads "Add Task". When the user clicks the add task button, a task card is generated and placed in the To Do column.
The user can then add additional tasks or exit.
When the user exits, by clicking the x, or by clicking outside the add task modal, the modal quits and the user is brought to the landing page.
The user will then see their added tasks in the to do column. The tasks are styled to green if the task is due in the future, yellow if the task is due today, and red if the task is past due.
The user can drag the task cards from one column to another, depending on its progress. The task card style will change to an all white background when the task is in the done column.
Each task card is rendered with a delete button, that will delete the task when clicked.
The task cards and delete function are saved to localStorage and will persist when refreshed.
All code was completed by Scott Reynolds.
